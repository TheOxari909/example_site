This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

most important files to edit are `app/page.tsx`, that's the landing page, individual pages are in `{folder}/page.tsx`. Each pages entry should be named `page.tsx`. 

Pages can also live several levels deep `app/pages/todo`.
